# Introduction
My name is Page Hewitt. I am from Cohasset, MA. I am a junior at Lehigh University and I am a journalism major, marketing minor. I am a writer for the Lehigh University newspaper, the [Brown and White](https://thebrownandwhite.com/). This is my page for my data journalism class. My personal Facebook page can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/page.hewitt). 

# About me
I am the oldest of three kids in my family. My younger brothers are sixteen and ten years old. A fun fact about me is that I love country music and my favorite food is chocolate. 

# Where I'm from
I am originally from Northern California and moved to Massachusetts when I was twelve so I have lived on both coasts of the United States. I have also driven across the country three times, once with my dad and twice with my grandmother. Some of my favorite places to see were the Grand Canyon, Arches and Yosemite National Parks and New Orleans. I love to travel and stay active outside.

# Why journalism?
I chose to major in journalism because I found the department to be a perfect mix of topics I am interested in. I have taken multiple classes about the role of the media in our society and I think it is a very real and relevant topic currently. Additionally, I love that journalism takes me out of my comfort zone and I get to interview and get to know tons of new people. I think that writing is a skill you will always need no matter what you do so I can take this skill foward in anything I end up doing.

# Top Music Platforms in 2021
Which music platform should you use? Everyone debates which music streaming platform is better or more popular so here is the data from 2021 showing which platforms are the most popular. I find this topic interesting and relevant as an Apple Music listener while many of my friends argue that I should get Spotify because they have it and so do many others. I found this data in the article [Music Streaming App Revenue and Usage Statistics](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/music-streaming-market/).

# 100 Years of Fashion

Fashion has evolved so much and yet so little in the past 100 years. I thought this data would best be shown in a timeline format to see the differences and similarities of trends over the past 100 years. It was also very interesting to see how directly fashion is effected by hisorical and societal factors of the times. I found this data and pictures in the article [100 Years of Fashion - Women's Fashion Then and Now](https://www.lapolo.in/blog/100-years-fashion-womens-fashion).

# Taylor Swift Album Sales

Taylor Swift is known for her massive success in the music industry. I think that comparing the sales of each of her albums shows an interesting perspective of which types of music has had the most success. It will be interesting to see her sales in the future because she is re recording a lot of her albums and adding unreleased songs. How will this change what her album sales look like? I found this data from the article [Taylor Swift album and song sales](https://chartmasters.org/2022/07/taylor-swift-albums-and-songs-sales/).

# US Unemployment Rates

The US unemployment rates over the past 20 years is interesting data to look at with the economic climate of the past two decades. It is especially interesting to see how COVID-19 has extremly changed the rate of unemployment causing a sharp increase. I also found it noticable that although unemployment is still increasing on the pattern that it was before, the levels recovered quickly after 2020. This was a much faster recovery then I thought was possible. I found this information from the article [Unemployment Rate by Year since 1929 Compared to Inflation and GDP](https://www.thebalancemoney.com/unemployment-rate-by-year-3305506).

# Top 10 Most Beautiful Places

The world is full of hundreds of natuarlly beautiful places that it is hard to consolidate a list of places that you must see. This map illustrates all over the world the top 10 most beautiful places according to Travel and Leisure.

It is also easy to plan seeing multiple destinations if someone wants to travel to an area that has a consolidation of beautiful places. I found this information from the article [55 of the World's Most Beautiful Places](https://www.travelandleisure.com/trip-ideas/most-beautiful-places-in-the-world-to-visit) and you can explore the sight to find even more beautiful places.

# Introduction
My name is Page Hewitt. I am from Cohasset, MA. I am a junior at Lehigh University and I am a journalism major, marketing minor. I am a writer for the Lehigh University newspaper, the [Brown and White](https://thebrownandwhite.com/). This is my page for my data journalism class. My personal Facebook page can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/page.hewitt). 

# About me
I am the oldest of three kids in my family. My younger brothers are sixteen and ten years old. A fun fact about me is that I love country music and my favorite food is chocolate. 

# Where I'm from
I am originally from Northern California and moved to Massachusetts when I was twelve so I have lived on both coasts of the United States. I have also driven across the country three times, once with my dad and twice with my grandmother. Some of my favorite places to see were the Grand Canyon, Arches and Yosemite National Parks and New Orleans. I love to travel and stay active outside.

# Why journalism?
I chose to major in journalism because I found the department to be a perfect mix of topics I am interested in. I have taken multiple classes about the role of the media in our society and I think it is a very real and relevant topic currently. Additionally, I love that journalism takes me out of my comfort zone and I get to interview and get to know tons of new people. I think that writing is a skill you will always need no matter what you do so I can take this skill foward in anything I end up doing.

# Lehigh Undergraduate Residence Data

# Top Music Platforms in 2021
Which music platform should you use? Everyone debates which music streaming platform is better or more popular so here is the data from 2021 showing which platforms are the most popular. I find this topic interesting and relevant as an Apple Music listener while many of my friends argue that I should get Spotify because they have it and so do many others. I found this data in the article [Music Streaming App Revenue and Usage Statistics](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/music-streaming-market/).
